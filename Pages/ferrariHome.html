            <p class="teamHistory"><strong>Scuderia Ferrari S.p.A.</strong> is the racing division of luxury 
            Italian auto manufacturer Ferrari and the racing team that competes in Formula One 
            racing. The team is also nicknamed <strong>"The Prancing Horse"</strong>, with reference to their logo.
             It is the oldest surviving and <strong>most successful Formula One team</strong>, having competed in 
             every world championship since the 1950 Formula One season. The team was founded
              by Enzo Ferrari, initially to race cars produced by Alfa Romeo, though by 1947 
              Ferrari had begun building its own cars. Among its important achievements outside 
              Formula One are winning the World Sportscar Championship, 24 Hours of Le Mans, 24 
              Hours of Spa, 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, Bathurst 12 Hour, races 
              for Grand tourer cars and racing on road courses of the Targa Florio, the Mille Miglia 
              and the Carrera Panamericana.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">As a constructor, Ferrari has a record 16 Constructors' 
            Championships, the last of which was won in 2008. Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, 
            Mike Hawthorn, Phil Hill, John Surtees, Niki Lauda, Jody Scheckter, Michael Schumacher
             and Kimi Raikkonen have won a record 15 Drivers' Championships for the team.
             Since Raikkonen's title in 2007 the team narrowly lost out on the 2008 drivers' 
             title with Felipe Massa and the 2010 and 2012 drivers' titles with Fernando Alonso.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory"><strong>Michael Schumacher</strong> is the team's most successful driver. 
            Joining the team in 1996 and departing in 2006 he won five drivers' titles and 72 
            Grands Prix for the team. His titles came consecutively between 2000 and 2004, and 
            the team won consecutive constructors' title from 1999 until the end of 2004; this 
            was the team's most successful period.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">Mercedes-Benz, through its subsidiary <strong>Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix Limited</strong>, 
            is currently involved in Formula One as a constructor under the name of 
            <strong>Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team</strong>. The team is based in Brackley, 
            Northamptonshire, United Kingdom, using a German licence. Mercedes-Benz 
            competed in the pre-war European Championship winning three titles and debuted 
            in Formula One in <strong>1954</strong>, running a team for two years. The team is also known by 
            their nickname, the <strong>"Silver Arrows"</strong>.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">After winning their first race at the <strong>1954 French Grand Prix</strong>, 
            driver Juan Manuel Fangio won another three Grands Prix to win the 1954 Drivers' 
            Championship and repeated this success in 1955. Despite winning two Drivers' 
            Championships, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from motor racing in response to the 1955 
            Le Mans disaster and did not return to Formula One until rejoining as an engine 
            supplier in association with Ilmor, a British independent high-performance 
            autosport engineering company later acquired by Mercedes, in 1994.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">In addition to its factory team, Mercedes currently 
            supplies engines to <strong>Racing Point and Williams</strong>. The manufacturer has collected 
            more than 180 wins as an engine supplier and is ranked second in Formula One history. 
            Seven Constructors' and 11 Drivers' Championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">Mercedes has become one of the most successful teams in 
            recent Formula One history, having achieved consecutive Drivers' and Constructors' 
            Championships from 2014 to 2019. In 2014, Mercedes managed 11 one-two finishes 
            beating McLaren's 1988 record of 10. The record was extended the following year 
            with 12 one-two finishes. Mercedes also collected 16 victories in 2014 and 2015 
            apiece breaking McLaren (1988) and Ferrari's (2002, 2004) record of 15. In 2016,
             they extended this record with <strong>19 wins</strong>.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">Red Bull Racing (currently sponsored name <strong>Aston Martin
             Red Bull Racing</strong> and also simply known as <strong>Red Bull or RBR</strong>) is a Formula One 
             racing team, racing a Honda powered car under an Austrian licence and 
             based in the United Kingdom. The team raced under a British licence from 
             2005 to 2006 and has raced under an Austrian licence since 2007. 
             It is one of two Formula One teams owned by beverage company Red Bull GmbH, 
             the other being Scuderia AlphaTauri (previously Scuderia Toro Rosso).
              The team has been managed by Christian Horner since its formation in 2005.</p>
                       
            <p class="teamHistory">Red Bull had Cosworth engines in 2005 and 
            Ferrari engines in 2006. The team used engines supplied by Renault 
            between 2007 and 2018 (from 2016 to 2018 the Renault engine was re-badged 
            "TAG Heuer" following the breakdown in the relationship between Red Bull and 
            Renault in 2015). During this partnership they won four successive Drivers' 
            and Constructors' Championship titles from 2010 to 2013, becoming the first 
            Austrian team to win the title. The team began using Honda engines in 2019.</p>

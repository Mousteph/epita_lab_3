            <p class="teamHistory">The French automotive manufacturer Renault has been 
            associated with Formula One as both constructor and engine supplier for various 
            periods since 1977. In 1977, the company entered Formula One as a constructor, 
            <strong>introducing the turbo engine to Formula One</strong> in its first car, the Renault RS01. 
            In 1983, Renault began supplying engines to other teams. Although the Renault team 
            won races and competed for world titles, it withdrew at the end of 1985. Renault 
            continued supplying engines to other teams until 1986, then again from 1989 to 1997 
            and at various other times since then until the present.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">Renault returned to Formula One in <strong>2000</strong> when it acquired 
            the Enstone-based Benetton Formula team (formerly Toleman). In 2002 Renault 
            re-branded the team as Renault F1 Team and started to use Renault as their 
            constructor name, winning both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships in 2005 and 2006.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">For the 2011 season the team competed under the name <strong>Lotus 
            Renault GP</strong> but retained the Renault constructor name. In 2012, the team changed 
            their constructor name to Lotus and operated as Lotus F1 Team until the end of 2015,
             when they returned to the control of Renault as a works manufacturer. For the 2019 
             season "Sport" was removed from the team's official title.</p>

            <p class="teamHistory">Renault has also supplied engines to other teams, 
            including Red Bull Racing (2007–2015) , Benetton Formula (1995–1997, 2001) 
            and Williams (1989–1997, 2012–2013). In addition to its two own F1 World Constructors' 
            Championships (2005, 2006) and two Drivers' Championships, as an engine supplier, 
            Renault has <strong>contributed to nine other World Drivers' Championships</strong>. It has collected 
            over 160 wins as engine supplier, ranking fourth in Formula One history.</p>
